## Some "real" samples involving the components of the other projects ##

### Home Weather Station ###
This one uses the <code>SDLWeather80422</code> class, from the <code>WeatherStation</code> project.
You can
- Read the data from the station 
- Simulate the data read from the station

Those data can then be rendered in different ways, with a Web Interface.
They are - for now - using a nodejs server and its WebSocket module.
